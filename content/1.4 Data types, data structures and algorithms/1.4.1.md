### Fixed Point
Fixed point is essentially represnting the decimal without it moveing meaning it is **fixed** in a certain place.
0|1|0|0|1|0|1|1
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
8|4|2|1|0.5|0.25|0.125|0.0625

`4.5625`

Problems with this method:
- overflows in the integer portion (16)
- overflows in the decimal portion (0.03125)
- overfows on both ends (16.03125)
- numbers that cant be represented by multiples of 2 (0.1)

### Floating Point
A floating point number consists of: the sign to show whether its positive or negative, the exponent which works like a x10^(exponent) except its in base 2 so x2^(exponent),the mantissa the string of numbers which makes the number.
