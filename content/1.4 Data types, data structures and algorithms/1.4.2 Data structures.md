# Data structures
## Array
An array is an **ordered**, **finite set of elements** of a **single type**. Arrays are usually 0 indexed (start with 0 not 1).

### Static and Dynamic
There are two types of data structures static and dynamic data structures. Stactic data structure can not expand while the program is running meaning they have a limited size, which make it much easier to program. Dynamic data structures are able to expand throughout the program which can be much more useful but also harder to code.
Static|Dynamic
------|-------
memory is allocated as the program exacutes|memory is allocated at compile time
**Advantage** possible for it overflow and underflow|**Advantage** easier to program
**Disadvantage** harder to program as th computer has to keep track of size and locations in memory at all times |**Disadvantage** can be inefficent as memory has to be set aside whether or not it is used.

#### 1D Array
```
[1,2,3]
```
#### 2D Array
```
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]]
```
#### 3D Array
```
[[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],
[[10,11,12],[13,14,15],[16,17,18]],
[[19,20,21],[22,23,24],[25,26,27]]]
```
## Lists
A list is a data structure consisting of a number of **ordered** items where the items can occur **more than once** and can have multiple types of variables.  
## Tuples
An ​**ordered set of values of any type**​ is called a tuple. A tuple is ​**immutable**​ (means it cannot be changed)​: elements cannot be added or removed once it has been created. Tuples are initialised using regular brackets instead of square brackets.

## Stacks
Stacks can be described by their name a stack, where the last variable added is on the top of the stack and thus will be the first to be taken off. This is called  Last In First Out (LIFO). Stacks are either static or dynamic; static making their maximum known and thus easier to program and taking less memory or dynamic without a defined maximum.

## Queues
Again the data type can be described by its name, the first varible in is the first one out (FIFO), this works like a queue in real life. There are two types of queues linear and circular. In **linear queues** variables are added to the end of the queue and removed from the front which means the queue indexs aren't being reused so the index keep getting bigger. A circular queue reuses past indexes keeping the end trailing behind the front.

## Trees
A tree is a fundemental data structure which consists of pointers and nodes. Every tree has a **root node** and link to **child nodes** which themselves have nodes spreading out like an upside down tree, the very bottom nodes not having any children nodes are called **leaf nodes**. An example of this data structure being used is in folders.

in-order|left|root|right
post-order|left|right|root

## Linked Lists

A like a array in that it stores multiple forms of data in a list like way. What seperates a linked list is that **each data point points to the next in the chain** at the end point to null. This makes it much easier to insert and remove peices of data as they can simply change their pointer to connect two different nodes(a node being a data point in this system). The pointer variable contains the address of the first variable.
