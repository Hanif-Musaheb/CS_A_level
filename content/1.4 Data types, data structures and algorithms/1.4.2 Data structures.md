# Data structures
### Static and Dynamic
There are two types of data structures static and dynamic data structures. Stactic data structure can not expand while the program is running meaning they have a limited size, which make it much easier to program. Dynamic data structures are able to expand throughout the program which can be much more useful but also harder to code.
Static|Dynamic
------|-------
memory is allocated as the program exacutes|memory is allocated at compile time
**Advantage** possible for it overflow and underflow|**Advantage** easier to program
**Disadvantage** harder to program as th computer has to keep track of size and locations in memory at all times |**Disadvantage** can be inefficent as memory has to be set aside whether or not it is used.
