## Search Algorithms
### Linear
This is the most basic way searching for a item in a list. You go through the list 1 by 1 checking if it is the number wanted.
### Binary
This **can only be used on sorted lists**. It compares the wanted item with the item in the middle of the list then it finds out whether the item is higher or lower in the list. It then split the list and continues untill the item is found or there is nothing in the list.
