# Thinking Abstractly
#### Representational Abstraction
This is a powerful technique whereby a problem is distilled from all the **excessive detail**. The more pure problem usually is already solved allowing 
programmers to use libraries and old sub routines to code the problem. This also means that idividual components of the problem can be worked on by 
different people allowing it to be **developed in parallel**.

#### Abstraction by Generalistion
Like representational abstraction it takes away unnecessary details, but then this allows sub_routines that are similar to be programmed using the 
same/similar code reducing the time and human resources used on it.

#### Data Abstraction
This is taking out the unnecessary details of a peice of data untill only the information needed for your purpose remains. For example a map of city could
have all the data related to trees and buildings taken away if a map only needs to show roads.

### Purpose
At its core, abstraction allows **non-experts**  to make use of a range of systems or models by **hiding information** that is ​**too complex or irrelevant**​
to the system’s purpose.

Abstraction can also increase the effieciency of a development as unnecessary details are purged early on which prevents the program from getting 
unnecessarily large.
