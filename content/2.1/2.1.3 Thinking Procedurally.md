# Thinking Procedurally
### First Stage (Identify components of the problem)
Take the problem defined by the user and break it down into its component parts (**problem decomposition**). <br>
An example of problem decomposoition:

This method can also be referred to as stepwise refinement which is usally used with large projects
### Second Stage (Identify the Components of a soloution)
This where we identify the lowest-level components of the soloution.<br>
During this stage, it is also useful to identify tasks which could be solved using an already ​**existing module, subroutine or library**​.
### Third Soloution (Order of steps needed to solve a problem)
When constructing the final soloution the **order in which operations is performed** becomes important as well as how they **interact with each other**.
