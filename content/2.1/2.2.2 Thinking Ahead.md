# Thinking Ahead
### Inputs and Outputs
Strip down every program consists of inputs and outputs.

### Caching
Caching is the process of storing instructions or values in cache memory

### Reusable Program Components
Reusable components are ​**more reliable**​ than newly-coded components, as they have **already been tested**​ and any bugs dealt with.
This ​**saves time, money and resources**​.

May not always be possible due to ​**compatibility issues**.
This may mean these components need to be modified to work which can sometimes be **more costly and time-consuming**
