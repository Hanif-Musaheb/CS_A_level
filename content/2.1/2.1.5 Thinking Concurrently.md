# Thinking Concurrently
### Concurrent Thinking (explanation by example)
You are given two tasks:
1) Record the number plate of all the cars that pass you in a given time, 
2)  Record the colour of all the cars that pass you in a given time.

<br>There are two ways of going about this: 

1) Record all the number plates of all the cars then record all the colors of all the cars
2) Record the number plate and the color of a car for all the cars.

Related parts of a problem can often be solved simultaneously, and therefore be dealt with concurrently.

**The difference between parallel processing and concurrent processing** - parallel processing is when multiple tasks are distributed across multiple 
processors. While Concurrent processing is when a processor gives a slice of processor time to different task to provide the illusion of the tasks being 
carried out seperately.

### Benefits and Drawbacks of Concurrent Processing
**Benefits:**
 - The number of tasks completed in a given time has increased.
 - Less time wasted waiting on user interaction
 **Drawbacks**
 - Concurrent processing can take longer to complete when large numbers of users or
tasks are involved as processes cannot be completed at once.**when there is alot of tasks it cant be completed at once**
- There is an​ overhead in coordinating​ and switching between processes, which
reduces program throughput.**(it takes processing power process concurrently)**
- Just as with parallel processing, not all tasks are suited to being broken up and
performed concurrently.**(not all tasks can be broken up like this)**
