# Input Output and Storage
- **Input devices** -- devices which input data into a computer. Examples: mouse, keyboard, Camera, Mic.
- **Output devices** -- devices which output data from a computer usually to the user of the computer. Examples: Monitor, Speakers, Printer.
- **Storage** -- stores data in devices such as Hardrives and SSDs 




- **Radio-frequency identification (RFID)** -- uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system consists of a tiny radio transponder, a radio receiver and transmitter. When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader. 

- **Scanners** -- Scanners are used to convert digital analog objects into digital bitmap images.

- **OCR** -- Optical character recognition basically interprets what a scanner inputs and turns it into a text file. It turns image data into strings.

- **Optical Mark Recognition** -- Recognizes marks on in specific predefined positions.

- **Bar code** -- A form of storage of information which is displayed as black and white lines.

- **MICR** -- Magnetic ink recognition uses a combination of ink containing iron oxide and specific fonts so that data written using this ink can be read by a specialist MICR reader.

- **Resistive Touch Screen** -- are touch screens that create a voltage when the two ITO touch. where that voltage is on the detectors on the x and y axis determines the place where the figer tip is on the screen. (Note that resistive screens can not handle more than one finger touch at a time). 
- **Projected Capacitive Touch Screen** -- These screens make use of the human bodies electric charge. The two main benefits are that capacitive screens have sharper a sharper image and that a person can uses multiple fingers; however this comes at a greater cost.
