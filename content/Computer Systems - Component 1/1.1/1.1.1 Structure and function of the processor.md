# Structure and function of the processor
- **RAM** - Random Access Memory is a very fast SSD which is located near the **CPU** to be even faster. Its function is to be store and output data very fast in order to assist computer programs. RAM is smaller relative to the primary storage as it is more expensive.
- **ROM** - Read Only Memory is specifically for storing data that will not be changed for example the BIOS for bootup and unchanging programs in embedded systems. It usually is a smaller size due to it usually containing smally very basic and optimized programs.
- **Optical Storage** - Optical storage is the storage of data on an optically readable medium. Data is recorded by making marks in a pattern that can be read back with the aid of light, usually a beam of laser light precisely focused on a spinning optical disc. A main Example of this is CDs which have a low amount of storage compared to other froms such as Hard Drives which is a magnetic form of storage. 
- **Magnetic Storage** - Magnetic storage is a type of storage which uses a very precise magnetic to make small dents in metal which can be read back making it non-volitile. Hard Drives the main form of magnetic storage is relativley cheap per terabyte of data. Hovever due to is moving parts is less durable.
- **Solid State Drive** - SSDs use switches called floating gate transistors. These create a special cage (the gate) that traps the electron flow within it. This gate effect continues whether there is electricity in the system or not, and so storage remains when the power is removed. SSDs are much more durable due to their lack of moving parts although they are more expensive. SSDs are faster than Hard Drives
- **Virtual storage** - This is when there isn't enough RAM and therefore it uses the slower primary storage. It's an area of secondary storage temporarily designated as RAM in case of the RAM becmoming overloaded.
