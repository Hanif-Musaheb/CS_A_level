### Von Neumann
The design of a von Neumann architecture machine is simpler than a Harvard architecture machineâ€”which is also a stored-program system but has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading and writing to memory, and another set of address and data buses to fetch instructions.

### Harvard
The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with **separate storage** and **single pathways** for instructions and data. It contrasts with the von Neumann architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways.

### Contemporary Architectures
- **x86** - is a family of instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address.

- **ARM** - The Arm architecture is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors. It is the most pervasive processor architecture in the world, with billions of Arm-based devices shipped every year, from sensors, wearables and smartphones to supercomputers. Benefits of the Arm CPU architecture include: Integrated security, High performance and energy efficiency, Large ecosystem for global support, Pervasive across markets and locations.
## Multicore and Parallel Systems
## CISC and RISC
### RISC
Reduced Instruction Set Computer is an architecture that processes very simple instructions that are processed in one clock cycle but more instructions for every task.A side effect of the simpler instructions set is that RISC architectures need a greater number of registers to provide faster access to data when programs are being executed.
### CISC
## Pipelining
## GPUs
