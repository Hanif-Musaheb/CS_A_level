### Von Neumann
The design of a von Neumann architecture machine is simpler than a Harvard architecture machineâ€”which is also a stored-program system but has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading and writing to memory, and another set of address and data buses to fetch instructions.

### Harvard
The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with **separate storage** and **single pathways** for instructions and data. It contrasts with the von Neumann architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways.

### Contemporary Architectures
- **x86** - is a family of instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address.

- **ARM** - The Arm architecture is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors. It is the most pervasive processor architecture in the world, with billions of Arm-based devices shipped every year, from sensors, wearables and smartphones to supercomputers. Benefits of the Arm CPU architecture include: Integrated security, High performance and energy efficiency, Large ecosystem for global support, Pervasive across markets and locations.
## Multicore and Parallel Systems
## CISC and RISC
### RISC
Reduced Instruction Set Computer is an architecture that processes very simple instructions that are processed in one clock cycle but more instructions for every task.A side effect of the simpler instructions set is that RISC architectures need a greater number of registers to provide faster access to data when programs are being executed.

### CISC
Complex instruction set computer is a computer in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store)CISC is something of an umbrella term for everything that is not RISC, where the typical differentiating characteristic is that most RISC designs use uniform instruction length for almost all instructions, and employ strictly separate load and store instructions.

## Pipelining
Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped during execution. Pipeline is divided into stages and these stages are connected with one another to form a pipe like structure. Instructions enter from one end and exit from another end.
This image show how in the FED cycle pipling is used so that there aren't gaps where the processorer could be fetch decoding or exacuting a command. Elimination of these gaps increases effeciency.

## GPUs
Graphical processing unit is the part of the computer that proccess more math heavy commands which can usually for application with grauphic demands like games or for math problems that can create things like bitcoin mining. The main difference between CPU and GPU architecture is that a CPU is designed to handle a wide-range of tasks quickly (as measured by CPU clock speed), but are limited in the concurrency of tasks that can be running. A GPU is designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video concurrently.
