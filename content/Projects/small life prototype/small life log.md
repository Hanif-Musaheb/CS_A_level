Finally get it to replicate at is border with no iternal replication meaning it works with much better performance than before as a bunch(~thousands) of hexagons aren't being spawned in.
Now I am trying to spawn the hexagons in at regular interavls meaning there wont be weird gaps. This is a picture of me changing the repliction distance.
(In this image it set 1.25*hexagon width=1.25)

Haven't made much progress but atleast I managed to change the color of the microbe to one much better. There are still weird gaps forming such as this common one where there is a singular missing hexagon on observation of seeing this form I predict it has something to do with the raycat being too long.
I have fixed a more distressing issue of a layer of hexagons forming a layer below the usual layer which was caused by me spawning in hexagos as if they were squares where they can be put directly on top of each other. That is not the case with hexagons, since they have 6 borders.
