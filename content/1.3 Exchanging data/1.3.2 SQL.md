# SQL

The Basic structure of SQL commands-

```SQL
SELECT (a feild)
FROM (the data base)
WHERE (a feild) = (a variable)
```
When you want to order it-
```SQL
SELECT (a feild)
FROM (the data base)
WHERE (a feild) = (a variable)
ORDER BY (ASC(for ascending) or DESC(for descending))
```
For creating tables-
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Member
(MemberID CHAR(4) PRIMARY KEY,
Firstname VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL,
Surname VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL ,
DateJoined DATE NOT NULL, 
SubPaid BOOLEAN)
```
- PRIIMARY KEY - is for specifying it as a primary key.
- NOT NULL - is for specifying that it must be filled in.
- CREATE TABLE is for creating the table.

```SQL
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
```
