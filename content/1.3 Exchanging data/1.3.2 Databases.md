# Databases
- **Database** - an organized collection of structured information, or data
- **Information** - data with context
- **Field** - a column
- **Record** - a row 
- **Table** -  Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database. 
- **Entity** - An entity is an object that exists. In database administration, an entity can be a single thing, person, place, or object. Data can be stored about such entities. 
- **Form** - It is a method of inputting and sometimes outputting data that usually uses a GUI.
- **Report** - A report is a database object that comes in handy when you want to present the information in your database for any of the following uses: Display or distribute a summary of data. Archive snapshots of the data. Provide details about individual records.

- **Relational database** - A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data points with defined relationships for easy access. In the relational database model, the data structures -- including data tables, indexes and views
- **Flat file database** - A flat-file database is a database of just one table. It can be created in database software or in a spreadsheet.

-|Flat file database | Relational database
-|-|-
Description|A single table within a database | A relational database uses multiple table structures.
Pros| Easy use, Easy setup, Inexpensive, Suitable for single file database, All records are in one place, simple and portable, requires a simple table (relation)| Reduced data redundency and more consistency, more data integrity (when changes are made for specifc feilds these changes are cascaded to any relation/table within the database that contain that feild.), supports multiple relations/tables that are linked together, increased security if data as it can set user access levels, more efficient searching and sorting of data through complex queries and faster access times --> use of indexes and indexing, can be accessed via a network.
Cons|Data redundancy (data duplication), Low security, No levels of authority, Takes more memory, searching can be inefficient|Very time consuming, more costly to maintain , training staff to use, expensive to design
Examples|[Flatfile Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90515435/133897501-8ef05940-b67d-4eef-a643-7009f64d321f.png)|[Relational Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90515435/133897553-aad192e9-a654-485f-8737-d73c60c987a1.png)



- **Query** - a request for data results from your database with perameters to narrow the search.
- **Complex Query** - a **Query** with multiple perameter.
### Validation
- **Validation** - determining whether entered information is sensible based on was has be stated as valid and not
- **Input mask** - what each characatar can be specifically which determines whether or not it is valid. (for example a phone number input mask would state that the entered data only be numbers as all phone numbers are.)
- **Primary key** - an identifer unique to a specific record which helps stop determining the difference to very similar records. (such as a student ID for two students with the same name) 
- **Foreign Key** - A foreign key is a set of attributes in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key links these two tables.
- **Composite Key** - A composite key is a specific type of primary key which uses the contents of two or more fields from a table to create a unique value.
- **Candidate Key** - (A feild that is considered when choosing a **Primary Key**). A candidate key is a specific type of field in a relational database that can identify each unique record independently of any other data. 
- **Secondary Key/s** - Feilds that aren't as unique or useful as the **Primary Key** but can still be used for other reasons.


### Data Normalisation
- **Normalisation** - 
- **Dependency** - Is when a table has a primary key for each row.
- **Partial Dependency** - Partial Dependency exists, when for a composite primary key, any attribute in the table depends only on a part of the primary key and not on the complete primary key.
To remove Partial dependency, we can divide the table, remove the attribute which is causing partial dependency, and move it to some other table where it fits in well.
- **Transitive Dependency** - Is when an entity depends on another entity not the primary key.

#### Rules of 1NF:

- **1NF (first normal form)** - To satisfy First normal form, each column of a table must have a single value. Columns which contain sets of values or nested records are not allowed.In the initial table, Subject contains a set of subject values, meaning it does not comply. To solve the problem, the subjects are extracted into a separate Subject table

  - Each column must be of a single value.
  - In each column the values must be of same kind.
  - Each column should have a unique name.
  - The order of your table dosen't matter

#### Rules of 2NF:

- **2NF (second normal form)** - The Book table has one candidate key (which is therefore the primary key), the composite key {Title, Format}.

  - Should be 1NF
  - No partial dependency

#### Rules of 3NF:

- **3NF (third normal form)** - “All attributes are dependent on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key”
  - Should be 2NF
  - Should have no transitive dependency

#### Transaction Processing
Transaction processing is information processing in computer science that is divided into individual, indivisible operations called transactions. Each transaction must succeed or fail as a complete unit; it can never be only partially complete. This is very important in a lot of application where partial computer processing would result in significant problems down the line. Such as in finacial applications like purchasing where an incomplete process may result in multple recorded purchases or no purchases.
  
### ACID
- **A** - (Atomicmicity) A transaction's changes to the state are atomic: either all happen or none happen. These changes include database changes, messages
- **C** - (Consistency) A transaction either creates a new and valid state of data, or, if any failure occurs, returns all data to its state before the transaction was started.
- **I** - (Isolation) A transaction in process and not yet committed must remain isolated from any other transaction.
- **D** - (Durability) Committed data is saved by the system such that, even in the event of a failure and system restart, the data is available in its correct state.

Validation Type| Method | Example
-|-|-
Check Digit| Uses the last 1 or 2 digits to check whether or not it is valid; the way the algorithm knows its the right number is usually dependent on the other numbers in the sequence for example the addition of the other numbers equals the check digit.|Barcodes have check digits.
Format Check| Certain data  can only come in a format therfore that can be checked whether or not the data is in that format and thus valid or not.| National insurance numbers have a specific
Length Check| Checks that the entered data is at the a valid length.| Some passwords have a minimum length
Lookup table|Looks up acceptable values in a table|There are only seven possible days of the week
Presence check|	Checks that data has been entered|	In certain databases a key field cannot be left blank
Range check|	Checks that a value falls within the specified range|	For example a age might be constricted to above 18 and below 65
Spell check|	Looks up words in a dictionary|	When word processing
