- **Query** - a request for data results from your database with perameters to narrow the search.

### Validation
- **Validation** - determining whether entered information is sensible based on was has be stated as valid and not
- **Input mask** - what each characatar can be specifically which determines whether or not it is valid. (for example a phone number input mask would state that the entered data only be numbers as all phone numbers are.)
- **Primary key** - an identifer unique to a specific record which helps stop determining the difference to very similar records. (such as a student ID for two students with the same name) 

Validation Type| Method | Example
-|-|-
Check Digit| Uses the last 1 or 2 digits to check whether or not it is valid; the way the algorithm knows its the right number is usually dependent on the other numbers in the sequence for example the addition of the other numbers equals the check digit.|Barcodes have check digits.
Format Check| Certain data  can only come in a format therfore that can be checked whether or not the data is in that format and thus valid or not.| National insurance numbers have a specific
Length Check| Checks that the entered data is at the a valid length.| Some passwords have a minimum length
Lookup table|Looks up acceptable values in a table|There are only seven possible days of the week
Presence check|	Checks that data has been entered|	In certain databases a key field cannot be left blank
Range check|	Checks that a value falls within the specified range|	For example a age might be constricted to above 18 and below 65
Spell check|	Looks up words in a dictionary|	When word processing
