# Databases
- **Database** - an organized collection of structured information, or data
- **Information** - data with context
- **Field** - a column
- **Record** - a row 
- **Table** -  Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database. 
- **Entity** - An entity is an object that exists. In database administration, an entity can be a single thing, person, place, or object. Data can be stored about such entities. 
- **Form** - It is a method of inputting and sometimes outputting data that usually uses a GUI.
- **Report** - A report is a database object that comes in handy when you want to present the information in your database for any of the following uses: Display or distribute a summary of data. Archive snapshots of the data. Provide details about individual records.

- **Relational database** - A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data points with defined relationships for easy access. In the relational database model, the data structures -- including data tables, indexes and views
- **Flat file database** - A flat-file database is a database of just one table. It can be created in database software or in a spreadsheet.

Description|A single table within a database | A relational database uses multiple table structures.
Pros| Easy use, Easy setup, Inexpensive, Suitable for single file database, All records are in one place, simple and portable, requires a simple table (relation)| Reduced data redundency and more consistency, more data integrity (when changes are made for specifc feilds these changes are cascaded to any relation/table within the database that contain that feild.), supports multiple relations/tables that are linked together, increased security if data as it can set user access levels, more efficient searching and sorting of data through complex queries and faster access times --> use of indexes and indexing, can be accessed via a network.
Cons|Data redundancy (data duplication), Low security, No levels of authority, Takes more memory, searching can be inefficient|Very time consuming, more costly to maintain , training staff to use, expensive to design
Examples|[Flatfile Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90515435/133897501-8ef05940-b67d-4eef-a643-7009f64d321f.png)|[Relational Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90515435/133897553-aad192e9-a654-485f-8737-d73c60c987a1.png)



- **Query** - a request for data results from your database with perameters to narrow the search.
- **Complex Query** - a **Query** with multiple perameter.
### Validation
- **Validation** - determining whether entered information is sensible based on was has be stated as valid and not
- **Input mask** - what each characatar can be specifically which determines whether or not it is valid. (for example a phone number input mask would state that the entered data only be numbers as all phone numbers are.)
- **Primary key** - an identifer unique to a specific record which helps stop determining the difference to very similar records. (such as a student ID for two students with the same name) 

Validation Type| Method | Example
-|-|-
Check Digit| Uses the last 1 or 2 digits to check whether or not it is valid; the way the algorithm knows its the right number is usually dependent on the other numbers in the sequence for example the addition of the other numbers equals the check digit.|Barcodes have check digits.
Format Check| Certain data  can only come in a format therfore that can be checked whether or not the data is in that format and thus valid or not.| National insurance numbers have a specific
Length Check| Checks that the entered data is at the a valid length.| Some passwords have a minimum length
Lookup table|Looks up acceptable values in a table|There are only seven possible days of the week
Presence check|	Checks that data has been entered|	In certain databases a key field cannot be left blank
Range check|	Checks that a value falls within the specified range|	For example a age might be constricted to above 18 and below 65
Spell check|	Looks up words in a dictionary|	When word processing
