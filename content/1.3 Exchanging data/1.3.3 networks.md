# Networks
### Charactaristics of a network
A network is simply two or more computers connected by ethernet or wifi (transmitting dat between each other). 
- **LAN** - Local area network a smaller network over a small geograuphic area.
- **WAN** - Wide area network is a larger network over a large geograuphic area, it usually comprises multiple small **LAN's**. **WAN's** require additional telecommunication hardware.
- **MAC address** a unique number to every device so that switchs and routers can send data to the right device.

In networks there are two types of topology the **physical** which is hoe the wires are layed out in real life. And there is **Logical** this is the how the data flows.

#### Logical Topologies

-  **Bus Topology** this is were the data flows a long a **backbone cable** which connects each of the terminals. At each end of the backbone cable there are terminators.

- **Star Topology** consists of a central node either a switch or a router that directs and receives data to the rest of the devices on the network.

- **Mesh Topology** This is when every computer/device is connected to every other.

Topology|advantage|disadvantage
-|-|-
Bus|cheaper,easier to setup, easy to add to the network|progressively worse as devices are added, collsions have to prevented, vunerable backbone, all computers can see the data transmission
Star|performance is consistant with heavy network traffic, a device can go down with out effecting the rest of the network, cheap to add to, no data collision| Expensive due to switch and cabaling, network vunerable to the switch going down
Mesh|fast connection,no collsions,no point of weakness in the network,better security as data doesn't pass other computers|costs increasing amounts to scale when wired, maintaining the network is difficulty

- **protocols** are a set of rules which every device abides to communicat with eachother on a network.

- **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)​ – Used for web page rendering, an encrypted version, ​**HTTPS** (Secure)​, is becoming more common
- **TCP/IP**​ ​(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) ​– This is a networking protocol used in the routing of packets through networks
- **POP3** (Post Office Protocol)​ and ​**IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol)​ – Mailing protocols, used for email access.
- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol)​ – Used for the transmission of files over networks.

### The Internet Structure
TCP/IP a stack of networking protocols taht work together in passing packets in networks.
Layer|Purpose
---|---
**(1st layer)** Application|For specifying the protocols to be used to translate the message (HTTP, POP3, FTP)
**(2nd layer)** Transport|For:establishing end-to-end encryption between source and receiver; splits the message into packets; if any packets get lost it request retransmission.
**(3rd layer)** Network|For:adding source and destination IP address;router need the network layer to work;the sockets then tell the packet which device to go to and which application.
**(4th layer)** Link Layer|For:MAC addresses of the source and destination


The role of the **domain name system** server (DNS server) is to translate these domain names into IP addresses when we wish to access a website.

### Network Communication
- Header
  - Sender and recipent IP address
  - Protocol being used
  - order of packets
  - Time to live (tells the packet when to expire)
- Payload
  - the raw data
- Trailer
  -  Checksum or cyclic redundancy check (to check all the packets have com and there are no errors)  

#### Circuit Switching and Packet Switching
There are two techniques for exchanging data over a network. 

- **Packet Switching** - Packets are sent across the most efficent route, which can vary for each packet.
- **Circuit Switching** - is a method of establishing a direct link between two devices and then continuing that through the devices conversation. Circuit switching requires both devices send and recieve information **at the same rate**.

Technique|advantages|disadvantages
---------|----------|------------
Packet Switching|takes the quickest most efficent route;   multiple ways checking it comes in the right order;   multiple routes can be used between devices so if one path breaks another can be used|time spent deconstructing and reconstructing;   must wait for all packets to arrive
Circuit Switching|no delay;   quicker reconstruction |holds up bandwith when there is no conversation;   devices must be at the same transfer rate; vunerable to be currupted and destroyed

### Network Security Threats
**Firewall** is a device to prevent **unauthorised access** to a network. The firewall filters the packets coming and going in accordance with admin rules. If the firewall does find a malicous packet then it either **rejects it** (sends an alert to the user) or **drops it** (deleted without an alert).
<br>
**Proxy servers** act as an itermediary sever that recieves and sends data on your behalf.
**Benefits:**
 - **privacy**, user remains **anonymous**
 - **caching** of frequently visited websites, faster load times
 - **reduce web traffic**
 - control of data that the user can see, **admin can prevent acsess**

**Encryption** is a way of making it harder for entities to understand intercepted information.

### Network Hardware
#### Nerwork Interface Cards
**NIC**'s are required to connect a device to a network the contain the mac address which is requirement for showing that the device you using is the source and recipent for data.
#### Switch
This is a peice of hardware that **direct flow of data** across a network. (commonly used in star network)
#### Wireless Acess Point (WAP)
This is a peice of hardware that lets devices connect via wifi. (**commonly combined with router** for a mesh network)
#### Router
**Connects 2 or more networks together.**
#### Gateway
A gateway is used for connecting 2 or more network wit**h different protocols**. The gateway **translates** them to the appropriate protocol so that the devices can communicate.
### Client-Server
Client-server networks consist of a client the computer terminal and a centraliszed server in which resources can be acsessed from. the server has a greater processing power than the terminals.
advantages|disadvantages
---------|----------
allows resources to shared|central point of failure
more secure for data|expensive setup
central backups|requires technitian
easy to locate resource|

**Peer to peer** is where devices are connected to each other and no computer has authority over another and data and resources are shared and requested amongst devices.
advantages|disadvantages
---------|----------
cheap to setup| can't trace sources
no technitian needed|less secure
no centralized point of failure|backups must be preformed seperately
share resources|difficult to locate resources
easy to maintain| -
