# Networks
### Charactaristics of a network
A network is simply two or more computers connected by ethernet or wifi (transmitting dat between each other). 
- **LAN** - Local area network a smaller network over a small geograuphic area.
- **WAN** - Wide area network is a larger network over a large geograuphic area, it usually comprises multiple small **LAN's**
- **MAC address** a unique number to every device so that switchs and routers can send data to the right device.

In networks there are two types of topology the **physical** which is hoe the wires are layed out in real life. And there is **Logical** this is the how the data flows.

#### Logical Topologies

-  **Bus Topology** this is were the data flows a long a **backbone cable** which connects each of the terminals. At each end of the backbone cable there are terminators.

- **Star Topology** consists of a central node either a switch or a router that directs and receives data to the rest of the devices on the network.

- **Mesh Topology** This is when every computer/device is connected to every other.

Topology|advantage|disadvantage
-|-|-
Bus|cheaper,easier to setup, easy to add to the network|progressively worse as devices are added, collsions have to prevented, vunerable backbone, all computers can see the data transmission
Star|performance is consistant with heavy network traffic, a device can go down with out effecting the rest of the network, cheap to add to, no data collision| Expensive due to switch and cabaling, network vunerable to the switch going down
Mesh|fast connection,no collsions,no point of weakness in the network,better security as data doesn't pass other computers|costs increasing amounts to scale when wired, maintaining the network is difficulty

- **protocols** are a set of rules which every device abides to communicat with eachother on a network.

- **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)​ – Used for web page rendering, an encrypted version, ​**HTTPS** (Secure)​, is becoming more common
- **TCP/IP**​ ​(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) ​– This is a networking protocol used in the routing of packets through networks
- **POP3** (Post Office Protocol)​ and ​**IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol)​ – Mailing protocols, used for email access.
- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol)​ – Used for the transmission of files over networks.

### The Internet Structure
TCP/IP a stack of networking protocols taht work together in passing packets in networks.
Layer|Purpose
---|---
**(1st layer)** Application|For specifying the protocols to be used to translate the message (HTTP, POP3, FTP)
**(2nd layer)** Transport|For:establishing end-to-end encryption between source and receiver; splits the message into packets; if any packets get lost it request retransmission.
**(3rd layer)** Network|For:adding source and destination IP address;router need the network layer to work;the sockets then tell the packet which device to go to and which application.
**(4th layer)** Link Layer|For:MAC addresses of the source and destination
