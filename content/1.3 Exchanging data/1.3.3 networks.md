# Networks
### Charactaristics of a network
A network is simply two or more computers connected by ethernet or wifi (transmitting dat between each other). 
- **LAN** - Local area network a smaller network over a small geograuphic area.
- **WAN** - Wide area network is a larger network over a large geograuphic area, it usually comprises multiple small **LAN's**
- **MAC address** a unique number to every device so that switchs and routers can send data to the right device.

In networks there are two types of topology the **physical** which is hoe the wires are layed out in real life. And there is **Logical** this is the how the data flows.

#### Logical Topologies

-  **Bus Topology** this is were the data flows a long a **backbone cable** which connects each of the terminals. At each end of the backbone cable there are terminators.

- **Star Topology** consists of a central node either a switch or a router that directs and receives data to the rest of the devices on the network.

- **Mesh Topology** This is when every computer/device is connected to every other.

Topology|advantage|disadvantage
-|-|-
Bus|cheaper,easier to setup, easy to add to the network|progressively worse as devices are added, collsions have to prevented, vunerable backbone, all computers can see the data transmission
Star|performance is consistant with heavy network traffic, a device can go down with out effecting the rest of the network, cheap to add to, no data collision| Expensive due to switch and cabaling, network vunerable to the switch going down
Mesh|fast connection,no collsions,no point of weakness in the network,better security as data doesn't pass other computers|costs increasing amounts to scale when wired, maintaining the network is difficulty
