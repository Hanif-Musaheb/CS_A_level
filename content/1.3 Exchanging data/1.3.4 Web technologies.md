## HTML

### Basic HTML tags
- ```<html> ```: All code written within these tags is interpreted as HTML
- ``` <body>``` : Defines the content in the main browser content area
- ```<link> ```: Used to link to additional files, like CSS stylesheets
- ``` <head>``` : Defines the browser tab or window heading area
- ```<title>``` : Defines the text that appears with the tab or window heading area
- ```<h1>, <h2>, <h3>``` :Heading styles in decreasing sizes
- ``` <p> ``` : paragraph seperated by a line above and below
- ```<img src=“source-image.png” width=“1000” height=“100”> ``` : A self-closing tag (there’s no need to include </img>) used for
images. Tag parameters include (src (source), height=x, width = y)
- ```<a href=“https://www.(a website).com”> the website </a> ```
- To create an oredered list (1. computer science \n 2.maths \n ... and so on):
 ```
   <ol>
          <li> Computer Science </li>
          <li> Maths </li>
          <li> Physics </li>
   </ol>
 ```
 - ``` <ul> the list </ul>``` turns the nubers in to generic bullet points.
 ### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is how websites advance their aesthetics beyond the basic words and images and color and themes to the website with more complicated graphics. CSS can be implemented in two ways embeded in the HTML script or linked to an external CSS file; the code to link an external css file: ``` <link hred= “styles.css” rel= “stylesheet” type= “text/css”>```

### Java Script
Java Script adds interactivity to a website and allowing for user input. Java Script uses a interprter instead of being compiled so that it can be displayed everytime on different devices, the Java Script code is dependent on the chips being used and therefore cant be compiled. Java Script can be used for user input on the clients' (users') computer instead of sending it staight to a server, the advantages of this:
- the local computer can fix invalid data before it is sent off to the servers
- it can ease the traffic on  busy servers
