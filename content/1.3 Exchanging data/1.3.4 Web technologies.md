## HTML

### Basic HTML tags
- ```<html> ```: All code written within these tags is interpreted as HTML
- ``` <body>``` : Defines the content in the main browser content area
- ```<link> ```: Used to link to additional files, like CSS stylesheets
- ``` <head>``` : Defines the browser tab or window heading area
- ```<title>``` : Defines the text that appears with the tab or window heading area
- ```<h1>, <h2>, <h3>``` :Heading styles in decreasing sizes
- ``` <p> ``` : paragraph seperated by a line above and below
- ```<img src=“source-image.png” width=“1000” height=“100”> ``` : A self-closing tag (there’s no need to include </img>) used for
images. Tag parameters include (src (source), height=x, width = y)
- ```<a href=“https://www.(a website).com”> the website </a> ```
- To create an oredered list (1. computer science \n 2.maths \n ... and so on):
 ```
   <ol>
          <li> Computer Science </li>
          <li> Maths </li>
          <li> Physics </li>
   </ol>
 ```
 - ``` <ul> the list </ul>``` turns the nubers in to generic bullet points.
 ### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is how websites advance their aesthetics beyond the basic words and images and color and themes to the website with more complicated graphics. CSS can be implemented in two ways embeded in the HTML script or linked to an external CSS file; the code to link an external css file: ``` <link hred= “styles.css” rel= “stylesheet” type= “text/css”>```

### Java Script
Java Script adds interactivity to a website and allowing for user input. Java Script uses a interprter instead of being compiled so that it can be displayed everytime on different devices, the Java Script code is dependent on the chips being used and therefore cant be compiled. Java Script can be used for user input on the clients' (users') computer instead of sending it staight to a server, the advantages of this:
- the local computer can fix invalid data before it is sent off to the servers
- it can ease the traffic on  busy servers
#### Outputs
```html
<!--Changing the attributes of a HTML element:-->
     chosenElement = document.getElementById(“example”);
     chosenElement.innerHTML = “Hello World”;
<!--Writing directly to the document:-->
     document.write(“Hello World”);
<!--You can use an alert box:-->
     alert(“Hello World”);
 <!--Java Script function-->
 function functionname() {
          // enter the code in here
}
```

#### Identifiers
Are unique functions(ones that are only used once), this is used for thing like headers where usually this only one header on a web page. To use identifier you use there name with hash tag infront of it.
#### Classes
Classes are similar execpt they can be reused as many tines as wanted , when used they are prfixed with a full stop.
## Search Engine Indexing
**Web Crawlers**- This are programs that go through the internet indexing websites by adding them to their search engines server of indexes with information they can find about such as meta data within the HTML file. Usually webcrawlers also rank the webpages' relevance with algoritms which usally are centered on the amount of amount of outbound and inbound links as with weighting towards links with a higher page rank. Some factors that effect page rank (even though there are believed to be more than 200 factors):
- using keywords in the <title> tags
- the age of a website as well as the frequency of upadates
- the number and relevancy of key words appearing in the ```<h1>``` tag
- the relevancy of domain name to the content
 
 ### Calculating PageRank 
 The page rank alogorithm was created by google as new better way of ranking pages which found the most relevant page better than the other page rank alogorithms at the time.
