# System Software
**System Software** -Systems software is software that governs the computer system. 

Purpose:
controls the hardware, including any peripherals allows other programs (applications) to run provides an interface for the user to interact with the computer maintains the system There are two kinds of systems software: operating systems utilities Utility software - Utility software helps maintain the system. Utility software includes: encryption software defragmentation software data compression softwarebackup software

- **Custom Software** - Customized software  is software that is specially developed for some specific organization or other user. As such, it can be contrasted with the use of software packages developed for the mass market,  such as commercial off-the-shelf software, or existing free software.

- **Generic software** - Software that can perform many different tasks and is not limited to one particular application. For example, a spreadsheet application is generic because it is useful for multiple purposes without modification, such as a calculating tool for engineers or a finance tool for accountants.

## OS
The OS is a computer program that manages the operations of the computer for the user. It communnicates between the user and the hardware.

### Types of OS
|Type of OS|Definintion|Example|
|----------|-----------|-------|
||||
|**Distributed**| This is type of OS that is run on multiple computers allowing it to distribute tasks on to multiple computers making it faster and spread the task over many computers.|Itranets are an example is system that is configured as a cluster of servers that share memory and tasks providing more power than a single large server and ressults in better preformance
|**Multi-Tasking**|This is the typical OS seen on computers able to preform many jobs simultaneously like Github and Spotify at the same time. To the user it appears these applications are being processed constantly but the CPU is just switch between tasks very fast| the OS on most peoples personal computers|
|**Multi-user Multi-tasking**|A single powerful mainframe or supercomputer is connected to many termionals all using the mainfrmae CPU, each terminal gets a slice of processor time according to the scheduling alogoritm explain in detail below.|This OS can be used on supercomputers which are much more capable than average computers meaning that the users can give it much harder problems like compplex simulations|
|**Mobile**|This operating system is similar to the multi-tasking OS but also comes with **utility software** that manages things specific to mobile devices such as cellular networks and wireless networks. The mobile OS is always paired with a real-time OS that is made for the devices' specific hardware|An iphone|
|**Real-time**|This is na OS that must:respond very quickly to any inputs; must be able to deal with many inputs simultaneosly; it must have failsafe mechanisms designed to detect and take appropriate action if hardware components fail; incorporate redundency| Fly by Wire|
|**Embedded**|this is an OS that preforms a small range of specific task on a single device which allows it consume less power.|Washing Machine|


### Components
#### Kernal (memory management)
It manages memory access for applications in the RAM, it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources and it organizes the data for long-term non-volatile storage with file systems on such media as disks, tapes, flash memory. The OS is also responsible for the security of the data in the memory
##### Paging
Included in this is paging and segmentation whereby data stored on the RAM by the OS.Paging is when main memory is divided into fixed size blocks called page-frames and programs are divided into blocks of the same size, called pages – pages are swapped’ between secondary storage and the page-frames as necessary. Paging is seperation of certain amounts of data like 4KB of data these pages aren't specifically placed in continous order and aren't logically seperated meaning when running code on the memory using the paging method it may be less efficent. 
##### Segmentation
Segmentation is when the data is logically divided into varying lengths depending on the program structure meaning that code for example that includes a loop won't be seperated from it condition unless necessary. Or in other words each segment corresponds to a logical division of code or data, where all the code or data that is needed is contained within the segment.

##### Virtual Memory
The OS has to deal with data when there is no space left on the RAM, in those situations the OS uses the secondary storage as RAM but only when necessary as it is much slower. 
#### Interrupts
Interrupts are signals from software, hardware and internal clocks that are recieved at the CPU. These interupts can occur for many reasons suck as reguarly by timers or by thing like hardware failures. To distinguish between the less and more important interupts, interupts have priorities.
##### Types of interupts:
- **Program Interrupt** - An interrupt generated by conditions in a program such as a division by zero error.
- **Timer** - Generated by the timer within the processor. This allows the operating system to perform certain functions at regular intervals.
- **I/O** - Interupts generated by an input or output device such as a mouse clicking.
- **Hardware Failure** - Geerated by the failure of hardware devices in the computer.

#### Processor Scheduling
With computer unable to run multiple applications simultaneously the OS needs to be able to allocate processor time to each one. Since a computer can only process one instruction at a time  it can get around this by carrying out small parts of multiple tasks it can give the appearance of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. The objectives of the scheduler are to:
- maximise throughput, be fair to all user on a multi-user system
- provide acceptable response time for all the users
- ensure that the hardware capacity is as full as possible

<Br>
Processor scheduling methods:
<Br>
  
-**Round Robin** - Round Robin allows programs certain amounts of time on the CPU; meaning it will rapidly change between different users as it process their command in their alloted time (their alloted time slices). The OS does this by have clock generate interupts to stop the program at the end of its time slice.
This method guarantees reasonable response time for all users.
  
-**First Come First Served**-Jobs are processed in the order in which they arrive, with no system priorities.
  
-**Shortest Remaining Time**-This method processes the commands that have the lowest estimated time of completion. This reduces the amount of small jobs behind big ones sent to be run by computers. A disadvantage of the method is that it requires an estimation of the time to completion, this disadvantage makes this method preferable for batch or regular jobs.
  
-**Shortest Job First**- This method is similar to shortest remaining time having the same advantages and disadavantages; the difference is that this program takes into consideration how time critical a task is. Which is why it is used at universities giving preferance to small jobs a waiting for less busy times to process non-critical big jobs.
  
-**Multi-level feedack queues** - This method gives preferance to: short jobs, I/O bound processes, it also seperates processes into categories based on their need for the processes. the method implements multiple queues for different jobs based on there amount of processing time. This method is made to maximise processor use.

##### Preemption  
In computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting an executing task, with the intention of resuming it at a later time. This interrupt is done by an external scheduler with no assistance or cooperation from the task.[1]: 153  This preemptive scheduler usually runs in the most privileged protection ring, meaning that interruption and resuming are considered highly secure actions.
  
#### File Management 
The OS is responsible for controlling the data stored on the secondary memory and the user interface which partially controls it and is responsible for filing, creation and deleting. For hard drives the OS is also responsible for disk defragmentation.
#### Networking
Currently most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. 
#### Security
The operating system must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed, and others which should not be processed, while some systems may simply distinguish between "privileged" and "non-privileged".
#### User Interface
The user interface views the directory structure and requests services from the operating system that will acquire data from input hardware devices, such as a keyboard, mouse or credit card reader, and requests operating system services to display prompts, status messages and such on output hardware devices, such as a video monitor or printer. 

The two most common forms of a user interface have historically been the command-line interface, where computer commands are typed out line-by-line, and the graphical user interface, where a visual environment (most commonly a WIMP) is present.
