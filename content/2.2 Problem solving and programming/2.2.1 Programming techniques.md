# Programming techniques
### Basic Programming Techniques
- **Sequence** is the order in which instructions occur and are processed.
- **Selection** determines which path a program takes when it is running using conditions.
- **Branching** - A branch is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order.
- **Iteration** is the repeated execution of a section of code when a program is running.

There are two types of iteration:
  
- **definite iteration** - count-controlled iteration
- **indefinite iteration** - condition-controlled iteration

#### Recursion
Simply it is when you make your code (or part of it) call itself creating a loop which can be ended by a condition stopping it from calling itself. 
#### Iteration
This is when a loop is used to process variable or output something until the desired result is reach or the loop has ended.
