# Programming techniques
### Basic Programming Techniques
- **Sequence** is the order in which instructions occur and are processed.
- **Selection** determines which path a program takes when it is running using conditions.
- **Branching** - A branch is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order.
- **Iteration** is the repeated execution of a section of code when a program is running.

There are two types of iteration:
  
- **definite iteration** - count-controlled iteration
- **indefinite iteration** - condition-controlled iteration
### Recursion VS Iteration
- **Recursion** - Simply it is when you make your code (or part of it) call itself creating a loop which can be ended by a condition stopping it from calling itself.[Recursive Code](https://github.com/Hanif-Musaheb/CS_A_level/blob/main/content/Projects/cool%20recursive%20code.md)

``` python
import turtle
turtle.tracer(0)
turtle.ht()
turtle.pu()
turtle.goto(-400,200)
turtle.pd()

def tri(a,depth,recursion):
    recursion+=1
    for i in range(3):
        turtle.fd(a)
        turtle.rt(120)
        if depth>recursion:tri(a/2,depth,recursion)
  
while True:
    turtle.update()
     tri(120,6,0)
  ```

- **Iteration** - This is when a loop is used to process variable or output something until the desired result is reach or the loop has ended.

``` python
import turtle
turtle.tracer(0)
turtle.ht()

for j in range(5):
    turtle.pu()
    turtle.goto(-400+(j*200),0)
    turtle.pd()
    for i in range(125):
        turtle.fd(10+i)
        turtle.rt(80+(j*20))

    turtle.update()

  ```
#### Key Differences between Recursion and Iteration
- A conditional statement decides the termination of recursion while a control variable’s value decide the termination of the iteration statement (except in the case of a while loop).
- Infinite recursion can lead to system crash whereas, infinite iteration consumes CPU cycles.
- Recursion repeatedly invokes the mechanism, and consequently the overhead, of method calls. This can be expensive in both processor time and memory space while iteration doesn’t.
- Recursion makes code smaller while iteration makes it longer.

### Global and Local Variables
- **Global Variables** - In computer programming, a global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible throughout the program. Practically this means at any point in the script you can reference it.
```python
def a_function(parameter1,parameter2):
  result=parameter1+parameter2
  global result
```
- **Local Variable** - In computer science, a local variable is a variable that is given local scope. Practically this means that they can only be referenced in the block they are made in for example a userdefined function.
```python
def a_function(parameter1,parameter2):
  result=parameter1+parameter2
  #here you could use the global or return fuction to get it out of the subroutine.
```
Local variables can be used for **encapsulation** when a variable is made to be local within a subroutine so that it doesnt effect the global varibles of the script.

### Modular Programming
This is when longer more complex tasks are broken down into subroutines which can be turned into a top down approach making it much easier for the programmer.
  
### IDE (Integrated Development Engine)
IDE's are used for **compiling**/**interpreting** running and editing code but it usually contains much more like highlighting errors, bracket completion and breakpoints.
  <br>
IDE provide tools to debug your code, such as:
- **Breakpoints** will stop the IDE from interpreting at that line which can be used for knowing whether or not the program reaches that line.
- A **watch** can be set on variable so that you can see it change throughout the program thus showing you when it changes to the undesired value.
- You can **step through** a program a line at a time so you can see what is happening.

### Software Testing
  Example of a condition to be tested. ```if num in range(0,100):```
- **Normal** data is within the range you would expecto work.(in this case in between 0 and 100)
- **Boundary** data is at what is thought to be the bounds of what the input can be.(in this case 1 and 100)
- **Erroneous** data is can be anything outside the percieved boundries of the valide inputs.(in this case something like 'dfvblsuv' would be erroneous)
