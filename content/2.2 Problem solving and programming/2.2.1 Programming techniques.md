# Programming techniques
### Basic Programming Techniques
- **Sequence** is the order in which instructions occur and are processed.
- **Selection** determines which path a program takes when it is running using conditions.
- **Branching** - A branch is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order.
- **Iteration** is the repeated execution of a section of code when a program is running.

There are two types of iteration:
  
- **definite iteration** - count-controlled iteration
- **indefinite iteration** - condition-controlled iteration
### Recursion VS Iteration
- **Recursion** - Simply it is when you make your code (or part of it) call itself creating a loop which can be ended by a condition stopping it from calling itself.[Recursive Code](https://github.com/Hanif-Musaheb/CS_A_level/blob/main/content/Projects/cool%20recursive%20code.md)

``` python
import turtle
turtle.tracer(0)
turtle.ht()
turtle.pu()
turtle.goto(-400,200)
turtle.pd()

def tri(a,depth,recursion):
    recursion+=1
    for i in range(3):
        turtle.fd(a)
        turtle.rt(120)
        if depth>recursion:tri(a/2,depth,recursion)
  
while True:
    turtle.update()
     tri(120,6,0)
  ```

- **Iteration** - This is when a loop is used to process variable or output something until the desired result is reach or the loop has ended.

``` python
import turtle
turtle.tracer(0)
turtle.ht()

for j in range(5):
    turtle.pu()
    turtle.goto(-400+(j*200),0)
    turtle.pd()
    for i in range(125):
        turtle.fd(10+i)
        turtle.rt(80+(j*20))

    turtle.update()

  ```
#### Key Differences between Recursion and Iteration
- A conditional statement decides the termination of recursion while a control variable’s value decide the termination of the iteration statement (except in the case of a while loop).
- Infinite recursion can lead to system crash whereas, infinite iteration consumes CPU cycles.
- Recursion repeatedly invokes the mechanism, and consequently the overhead, of method calls. This can be expensive in both processor time and memory space while iteration doesn’t.
- Recursion makes code smaller while iteration makes it longer.

### Global and Local Variables
- **Global Variables** - In computer programming, a global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible throughout the program. Practically this means at any point in the script you can reference it.
```python
def a_function(parameter1,parameter2):
  result=parameter1+parameter2
  global result
```
- **Local Variable** - In computer science, a local variable is a variable that is given local scope. Practically this means that they can only be referenced in the block they are made in for example a userdefined function.
```python
def a_function(parameter1,parameter2):
  result=parameter1+parameter2
  #here you could use the global or return fuction to get it out of the subroutine.
```
Local variables can be used for **encapsulation** when a variable is made to be local within a subroutine so that it doesnt effect the global varibles of the script.

### Modular Programming
This is when longer more complex tasks are broken down into subroutines which can be turned into a top down approach making it much easier for the programmer.
  
### IDE (Integrated Development Engine)
IDE's are used for **compiling**/**interpreting** running and editing code but it usually contains much more like highlighting errors, bracket completion and breakpoints.
  <br>
IDE provide tools to debug your code, such as:
- **Breakpoints** will stop the IDE from interpreting at that line which can be used for knowing whether or not the program reaches that line.
- A **watch** can be set on variable so that you can see it change throughout the program thus showing you when it changes to the undesired value.
- You can **step through** a program a line at a time so you can see what is happening.

### Software Testing
  Example of a condition to be tested. ```if num in range(0,100):```
- **Normal** data is within the range you would expecto work.(in this case in between 0 and 100)
- **Boundary** data is at what is thought to be the bounds of what the input can be.(in this case 1 and 100)
- **Erroneous** data is can be anything outside the percieved boundries of the valide inputs.(in this case something like 'dfvblsuv' would be erroneous)

## Object Oriented Program
  The core to OOP is objects which a created, instantiatied and manipulated in a differnet way to procedural code making it different.
  
``` python
 class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):#initiator method
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):#procedure
        print(self.length * self.width)

    def perimeter(self):#function
        return 2 * self.length + 2 * self.width

class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, length):#here the super function inherits the length value from retangle
        super().__init__(length, length)#the super function inherities the attribut length from the class Rectangle
```
### Encapsulation
 The variables assigned to a class are called attributes and can vary in scope, variables can be resticted to the method the are in (**local varibles**) or have acsess to the entire program (**global variables**). This can be very useful as a lot of vatiables aren't used throughout the script and once used pose the risk of bugs and a potential security problem furthermore when collaborating in a team if the variables are global people in the team are more likely to make the mistake of naming a variable the name of a variable already made. The process of keeping variables in a method is called **encapsulation**.
### Inheritance
Inheritance is passing attributes and behaviors between classes this is done in the form were one class is the parent and one is a child and like in reality a child inherits from their parent.```Parent--------------------------------->Child
                                              (behaviors and attributes)```

  
**Overloaded functions** - Overloaded functions describe the situation where programmers create two or more functions with the same name in the same scope. The procedural programming model places all functions in the same, global scope, so all functions with the same name are overloaded.
Procedural |Object Oriented Programming|
  --------------|----------|
  In procedural programming, program is divided into small parts called functions.|In object oriented programming, program is divided into small parts called objects.|
  Pocedural is a top down approach|OOP is bottom up|
  Procedural programming does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is **less secure**|	Object oriented programming provides data hiding so it is **more secure**.|
  In procedural programming, overloading is not possible.|	Overloading is possible in object oriented programming.|
  Examples: C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic etc.|	Examples: C++, Java, Python, C# etc.|
 
  - **Method**- Function inside class also known as a **Behavior**
  
  - **Procedure** - a method that doesn't return
  
  - **Function** - a method that doesn't return a variable
